# EcoBloom - Cleanliness Campaign Platform

## Overview

EcoBloom is a web platform designed to facilitate and incentivize cleanliness campaigns organised by various entities. Users can actively participate in campaigns, earn rewards, and contribute to a cleaner environment. The project utilizes **ReactJS** for the frontend, **Firebase** for authentication, real-time updates, and hosting, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **MongoDB** for data storage. 

We've also utilised the very special **Realtime Database** provided by Firebase to maintain the chats of our users, and the **Firebase Storage** for storing file uploads in a logical, hierarchical manner. 
In addition, we've also integrated AI/ML into our site, by utilising an open-source Face-Recognition and Face-Comparison model provided by Face++ to verify users at the campaign sites.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up EcoBloom locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecobloom.git
   cd ecobloom

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd functions && npm install

3. Testing Credentials
    1. User:
       email: testing@gmail.com
       password: testing
    2. Organisation:
       email: greenpeacuk@gmail.com
       password: testing

### Configuration

To initialise and configure , follow these steps:

1. Create a firebase project here.
2. The service account key will be made available if required. Without it, you will not be able to run the Firebase Admin SDK locally.
3. Create a .env file in the project root and add your Firebase config:
   
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_DEPLOYED_API_URL= deployed-app-url
   REACT_APP_LOCAL_API_URL= local-api-url
   REACT_APP_API_KEY= your-api-key
   REACT_APP_DEPLOYED_URL= your-project.web.app
   REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID= your-project-id
   REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID= messaging-sender-id
   REACT_APP_APP_ID= your-app-id
   REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID= your-measurement-id
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY= your-google-maps-api
   
4. Create a .env file in the functions folder and add your Firebase and MongoDB config:
   
    ```bash
   DEPLOYED_URL= deployed-url
   API_URL= your-api-url
   LOCAL_API_URL= your-local-api-url
   MONGO_URI= your-api-key
   API_KEY= your-api-key
   DEPLOYED_URL= your-deployed-url
   AUTH_DOMAIN= your-auth-domain
   PROJECT_ID= your-project-id
   BUCKET_ID= your-bucket-id
   MESSAGING_SENDER_ID= your-messaging-sender-id
   APP_ID= your-app-id
   MEASUREMENT_ID= your-measurement-key
   JWT_SECRET_KEY= your-jwt-secret-key
    ```


### Usage

1. Run the development server for the frontend:

  ```bash
npm run start
```
2. Optionally, if you wish to test the API locally, you can run the Firebase Functions and Storage emulators:
```
firebase emulators:start --only functions,storage
```
or, just run this script from the root directory of the project which starts the required Firebase emulators:
```
npm run serve
```


## Key Highlights


### Authentication

- EcoBloom implements **Firebase Authentication** for secure user login and signup. We have extensively utilised the Custom Claims feature of Firebase Auth to account for our 3 types of users: Organisations, Participants, and Admin.

- We've also implemented two types of Auth Providers provided by Firebase: Google, and Email/Password. We would also be adding Facebook Auth later in the future!

#### User Auth

- A user can either choose to register using the sign-up form, or get automatically signed up (and signed in) by directly clicking the Google Sign-in option made available on the `/login` route. We've tried to make our queries as ACID compliant as they can be (as an example, a Firebase Auth user cannot be created until the entire process is completed, which consists of creating a record in our database as well by implementing transactions).

- While sign-up, it's **mandatory** for the user to upload a **_good quality, plain recent photo of their face with no other faces in the background_**. This is required to verify the users at the campaign sites, which makes up our points and rewards system.
  
- **Note:** if you do not have an account and choose to Google sign-in, it will also create an account in our database with the chosen account, with the default photo as your Google Account's profile. **You must change this photo from the User Profile settings available on the top-right of the User Dashboard.** Since Google Login will also handle the registration if the account does not exist, it may take some time before you get logged in.

#### Organisation Auth

- Organisations **must** sign-up through the sign-up form provided on the `/signup/org` route provided. This is because the organisation is required to upload a photo of it's logo, banner, and a relevant **document** that would let us verify your organisation. The file sizes must be kept as minimal as possible, each **not exceeding 200kb**.
  
- Once sign up is done, the organisation must wait to be **verified** by us before you can login and start posting campaigns! Don't worry, the verification process usually takes only 1-2 days! :)

#### Admin Auth

- Admin's credentials are set manually by us. Once logged in, the admin will be able to view a list of all the organisations, their uploaded documents, and an option to verify that organisation. Once the organisation is verified, they can login and start organising campaigns and building up their community!

### Campaign Creation

- Organisations can easily create and launch campaigns through an intuitive interface. Tailored for simplicity, this feature allows campaign organisers to set goals, define participation criteria, and engage the community seamlessly.
  
- Campaign creation makes use of the **Google Maps API** to allow the organisation to select the place where the campaign is going to be organised on the map.

### Campaign Participation

- Users can actively join and participate in cleanliness campaigns, contributing to a cleaner environment. Each campaign has a page tailored to its information to display everything that the user needs to know about it (the rules, guidelines, location, points, etc.)
  
- Users can choose to register for an **upcoming or an ongoing** campaign. If you registered for a campaign but are not able to attend it, worry not! You won't be penalised for false registrations.

### Community and Bonding

- There's a high chance that while participating in some campaign, you came across really nice and like-minded people :)! But did you forget to exchange contact, or would you like to get close to these amazing people who are helping out this world just like you? We've got you covered, with our community chat feature!

- Community chat allows the users to chat with all the members who've joined that organisation's community, allowing for a better bonding between the members of an organisation.

- The organisation also has the feature to create posts, which can spread a smile on the face of their members, and others who are interested!

### Gamification

- EcoBloom incorporates a gamified point system, encouraging users through rewards for their active involvement in campaigns.
  
- Once a user registers for a campaign and the campaign starts, the user has to, ofcourse, be physically present at the campaign site.
  
- Before or after the campaign ends, a face-recognition system (which is made available on the campaign page in the organisation portal) will be used to match each participant and the photo they uploaded while sign-up. This part is handled by any member of the organisation present at the site.
  
- Upon successful verification, the user obtains points and they can view those points in their Activity Log / Store page, which can be redeemed for exciting merch made available by EcoBloom! (we have not implemented a payment gateway / delivery system as of now, as it requires alot of verification and paperwork, and also since we do not actually have these products available for shipping but just a concept or an idea about it)

- It is to note that these points are updated only after the campaign ends. When the campaign ends, all the verified users will have their points updated. This is handled through a cron-job, which runs every 10 minutes to check whether any campaign has ended or not.
